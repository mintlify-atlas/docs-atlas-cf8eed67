Once you have fzf installed on your system, you can enable it inside Vim by adding the directory to your `&runtimepath`.

## Using vim-plug (Recommended)

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is the easiest way to install the fzf Vim plugin. Add one of the following to your Vim configuration file:

### Option 1: Use Local Installation

If you've already installed fzf via Homebrew or another package manager, point vim-plug to that location:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Homebrew (Intel Mac)
" If installed using Homebrew
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'
```

```vim Homebrew (Apple Silicon)
" If installed using Homebrew on Apple Silicon
Plug '/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf'
```

```vim Git Clone
" If you have cloned fzf on ~/.fzf directory
Plug '~/.fzf'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Option 2: Install from GitHub

For the latest Vim plugin file from GitHub rather than the one included in the package:

```vim
" Basic installation
Plug 'junegunn/fzf'
```

The Vim plugin will pick up the fzf binary available on your system. If fzf is not found on `$PATH`, it will ask if it should download the latest binary for you.

### Option 3: Auto-Update Binary

To ensure you always have the latest version of the binary, set up a post-update hook:

```vim
" Automatically install/update fzf binary
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
```

<Tip>
This is the recommended approach as it keeps both the plugin and binary up to date automatically.
</Tip>

## Installing fzf.vim (Optional)

While the base fzf plugin provides core functions, [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) is a separate project that provides many useful commands like `:Files`, `:Buffers`, `:Rg`, and more.

```vim
" Install both fzf and fzf.vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

<Note>
`junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions, while `junegunn/fzf.vim` provides a variety of useful pre-built commands.
</Note>

## Manual Installation

If you don't use vim-plug, you can manually add fzf to your runtime path. Add one of the following lines to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Homebrew (Intel Mac)
" If installed using Homebrew
set rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf
```

```vim Homebrew (Apple Silicon)
" If installed using Homebrew on Apple Silicon
set rtp+=/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf
```

```vim Git Clone
" If you have cloned fzf on ~/.fzf directory
set rtp+=~/.fzf
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
The path may differ depending on your installation method and operating system. Make sure the path points to the directory containing the `plugin` subdirectory.
</Warning>

## Verify Installation

After installing, restart Vim and try running:

```vim
:FZF
```

You should see the fzf interface appear. If it works, you're all set!

## Terminal Buffer Colors

On the latest versions of Vim and Neovim, fzf will start in a terminal buffer. If you find the default ANSI colors to be different from your expectations, you can configure them:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Neovim">
    ```vim
    " Terminal colors for seoul256 color scheme
    let g:terminal_color_0 = '#4e4e4e'
    let g:terminal_color_1 = '#d68787'
    let g:terminal_color_2 = '#5f865f'
    let g:terminal_color_3 = '#d8af5f'
    let g:terminal_color_4 = '#85add4'
    let g:terminal_color_5 = '#d7afaf'
    let g:terminal_color_6 = '#87afaf'
    let g:terminal_color_7 = '#d0d0d0'
    let g:terminal_color_8 = '#626262'
    let g:terminal_color_9 = '#d75f87'
    let g:terminal_color_10 = '#87af87'
    let g:terminal_color_11 = '#ffd787'
    let g:terminal_color_12 = '#add4fb'
    let g:terminal_color_13 = '#ffafaf'
    let g:terminal_color_14 = '#87d7d7'
    let g:terminal_color_15 = '#e4e4e4'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vim">
    ```vim
    " Terminal colors for seoul256 color scheme
    let g:terminal_ansi_colors = [
      \ '#4e4e4e', '#d68787', '#5f865f', '#d8af5f',
      \ '#85add4', '#d7afaf', '#87afaf', '#d0d0d0',
      \ '#626262', '#d75f87', '#87af87', '#ffd787',
      \ '#add4fb', '#ffafaf', '#87d7d7', '#e4e4e4'
    \ ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
