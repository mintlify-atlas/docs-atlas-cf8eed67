---

The Vim plugin for fzf provides seamless integration between the fuzzy finder and your Vim workflow. It offers core functions for building custom commands and a basic file selector to get you started.

## Core Components

The Vim plugin provides three essential components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="fzf#run() function">
    Starts fzf inside Vim with a spec dictionary, giving you full control over sources, sinks, and options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="fzf#wrap() function">
    Wraps your spec with global preferences like `g:fzf_layout`, `g:fzf_action`, and `g:fzf_colors` for consistent behavior.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title=":FZF command">
    A basic fuzzy file selector built on top of `fzf#run()` - perfect for quick file navigation or as a reference implementation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can Build

With these core functions, you can create powerful custom commands:

- **File selectors** with custom sources (git files, recent files, buffers)
- **Color scheme pickers** for instant theme switching
- **Custom fuzzy finders** for any list-based data
- **Advanced commands** with multi-select and custom key bindings

<Note>
The most important function is `fzf#run()`, but we'll start with the `:FZF` command to understand the basics before diving into custom implementations.
</Note>

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example using the built-in `:FZF` command:

```vim
" Look for files under current directory
:FZF

" Look for files under your home directory
:FZF ~

" With fzf command-line options
:FZF --reverse --info=inline /tmp

" Bang version starts fzf in fullscreen mode
:FZF!
```

Similar to ctrlp.vim, use these key bindings to open selected files:

- `Enter` - Open in current window
- `CTRL-T` - Open in new tab
- `CTRL-X` - Open in horizontal split
- `CTRL-V` - Open in vertical split

<Tip>
The environment variables `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` and `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` also apply to the Vim plugin.
</Tip>

## For Neovim Users

<Note>
If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as an alternative with native Neovim integration.
